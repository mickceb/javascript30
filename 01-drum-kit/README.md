# Project 1 of 30 of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

## What I have learned

In this project I created a Drum kit based on JS, HTML & CSS.
Play the drum simply by putting the corresponding key. When you press the key "a" (for example) , you'll see the corresponding box growing and a clap will be heard.

For that, un addEventListener has been binded to ""keydown" and the callback function triggers 1) the corresponding song and 2) the expansion of the box.
