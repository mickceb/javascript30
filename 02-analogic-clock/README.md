# Project 2 of 30 of [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

## What I have learned

In this exercice, I have learned how to change the `transform-origin` and to set in motion to each clock hand. The challenge is to get the time and transform it into degree, and give life to the clock with the function `setInterval`.
